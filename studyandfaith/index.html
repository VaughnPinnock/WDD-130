                        in
                        absolute amazement of
                        the leaders of the church leaders. The also seem to be so well read and knowledgeable on wide
                        cross-
                        section of topics.
                        If you have wondered how they got to be that way the answer to that question can be found in the
                        Doctrine & Covenants,
