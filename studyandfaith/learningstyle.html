                    <p>Think about a teacher that you have had that has really helped you to learn. What did they do
                        differently from the other
                        teachers that you have had? Was it the subject that was just really interesting? or did they
                        find a way to bring across
                        the material that you really enjoyed? The truth is that we all learn differently Visual, Aural,
                        Read/Write and
                        Kinesthetics (VARK) and the sooner we know what learning style is best for us then the better we
                        will be able to do
                        meaningful studying.</p>

                    <p>Does listening to the scriptures as you read make it much easier for you to understand? Would a
                        visual of Captain
                        Moroni’ s battle preparations make you comprehend that much more? Taking our quiz on what
                        learning type you are will

                    <p>“Humility is the awareness that there’s a lot you don’t know and that a lot of what you think you
                        know is distorted or
                        wrong.” - David Brooks - The Road to Character
